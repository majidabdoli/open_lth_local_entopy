Due to the unstructured nature of pruning in the Lth method, it performs pruning without considering the location and neighborhood in the input data. In this research, a method to consider the correlation of weights during pruning (WBP) is presented. Also, the amount of pruning is limited to the amount of information available in that area (WEBP).

Jonathan Frankle's code is in the master folder, and the changes made in the pruning folder are placed in the sparse_local.py and sparse_entropy.py files. To create a mask using the WBP and WEBP methods, the contents of the sparse_local.py and sparse_entropy.py files must be placed in the place of sparse_global.py, respectively.
